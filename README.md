# Qengine (3D) — Volumetric Substrate  
**Quansistor Field Simulation in Three Dimensions**

## Overview

Qengine (3D) extends the 2D quansistor simulator into a **three-dimensional volumetric substrate**.
The goal is not realism, but exploration of how operator-based locality, causality, and auditability scale with dimensional complexity.

---

## What Changes in 3D

- Volumetric neighborhoods
- Surface-based region boundaries
- Richer connectivity and topology
- Increased partitioning complexity

What **does not change**:
- operator-first semantics,
- no-signalling guarantees,
- deterministic replay,
- invariant-based auditability.

---

## Key Contributions

- Defines 3D quansistor lattices
- Generalizes invariant fields volumetrically
- Extends mobile composite objects to 3D
- Preserves causal scheduling and determinism
- Demonstrates scalable audit under complexity

---

## Architectural Insights

Qengine (3D) shows that:
- complexity increases cost, not semantics,
- causality remains enforceable,
- invariants remain sufficient for verification,
- global coordination is unnecessary.

---

## Relation to QFC and QVM

This model acts as:
- a stress-test for QFC semantics,
- a volumetric execution analog for QVM,
- a bridge toward richer invariant hierarchies.

---

## Intended Audience

- Advanced QFC researchers
- Readers exploring execution under topological complexity
- Designers of scalable audit-native systems

---

## Status

Advanced experimental model.  
Semantically stable, complexity-extending.
